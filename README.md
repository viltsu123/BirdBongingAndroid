# BirdBongingAndroid
Android game application


This is my Android Native application i made as a school project. It has CRUD functionality, some game actions, sounds,
tab views and all sorts

This thing really taught me about media handling in Android, Database creations and their functionalities, User based 
design and content creation. What can i say, it was a fun project! :) The game itself works as the Insert to the database. You 
chase after birds on the screen and get points for it. The app keeps track of what you catch and then everything is displayed on
the Birds Bonged view :) it works as a swipable tab view which has a list of all the birds you caught, an info view of the birds 
which you are hunting for and a general points view of your total points. Cool little package, The pictures tell a lot though :)
